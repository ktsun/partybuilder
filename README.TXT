Why use Builder Pattern in the party builder case?

The parameters to the constructor are reduced and are provided in highly readable method calls. 
It increases design flexibility and provides much more readable code. 
The builder pattern helps us in creating immutable classes with large set of state attributes, reducing numbers of constructors and setters to avoid changing itâ€™s state. 

However, the number of lines of code increase to double in builder pattern.
